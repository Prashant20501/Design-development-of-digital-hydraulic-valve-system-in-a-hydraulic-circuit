# Design-development-of-digital-hydraulic-valve-system-in-a-hydraulic-circuit
Replaced conventional DCVs with digital shut-off valves to reduce costs and maintenance. Automated control using a PID controller and S-function in Matlab Simulink. Achieved efficient, scalable performance with reduced energy use. Future work includes optimizing valve count and exploring advanced controllers for further improvements.

# Objective: Replace conventional proportional DCVs with cost-effective digital binary shut-off valves to reduce maintenance and operational costs in hydraulic systems.
* Designed a hydraulic circuit to substitute expensive proportional DCVs with multiple digital valves, improving energy efficiency and reducing maintenance requirements.
*	Manually controlled the opening/closing times of individual valves, demonstrating the potential for precise control with reduced costs.
*	Implemented PID and S-function in MATLAB Simulink to automate valve control, enhancing scalability and reducing the need for human intervention.
*	Outcome: Successfully integrated digital valves with a PID controller, achieving similar displacement characteristics as traditional systems while enabling automation and reducing system errors.
*	Tech Stack: MATLAB Simulink, PID Control, S-function, Digital Valve Technology
