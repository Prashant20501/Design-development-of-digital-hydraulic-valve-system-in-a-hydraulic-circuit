# Design-development-of-digital-hydraulic-valve-system-in-a-hydraulic-circuit
Replaced conventional DCVs with digital shut-off valves to reduce costs and maintenance. Automated control using a PID controller and S-function in Matlab Simulink. Achieved efficient, scalable performance with reduced energy use. Future work includes optimizing valve count and exploring advanced controllers for further improvements.
